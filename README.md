# SRP-with-Feature-Recommendation-system
This attachment contains code for a feature recommendation system that leverages TFIDF vectorization and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to suggest relevant features based on 
textual descriptions. The system uses cosine similarity to measure the similarity between 
feature descriptions and employs RL for training a decision-making agent.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
scikit-learn
seaborn
bash
code:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn
Usage
Ensure the required libraries are installed.
Provide your feature descriptions in an Excel file with multiple sheets.
Run the code to train the RL agent and visualize the results.
• Data Loading and Preprocessing:
• Loads feature descriptions from an Excel file ('ASN3-Run1-Dataset.xlsx').
• Concatenates descriptions into a single column for TF-IDF vectorization.
• TF-IDF Vectorization:
• Utilizes scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer to transform text data into TF-IDF 
matrices.
• Visualizes the TF-IDF matrix as a heatmap.
Cosine Similarity:
• Calculates the cosine similarity matrix based on TF-IDF vectors.
• Visualizes the cosine similarity matrix as a heatmap.
• RL Environment:
• Sets up a custom RL environment for feature recommendation.
• Implements a simple RL environment class 
(FeatureRecommendationEnvironment).
• Reward Calculation:
• Defines reward calculation functions based on description length and 
textual similarity.
• Plots reward functions with respect to length and similarity.
• RL Training Function:
• Implements an RL training function (run_rl_training) using Q-learning.
• Tests different learning rates and visualizes the results.
Results and Visualization
• Heatmaps:
• Displays the TF-IDF matrix heatmap and the cosine similarity matrix 
heatmap.
• Reward Function Visualization:
• Plots reward functions with respect to description length and textual 
similarity.
• RL Training Results:
• Presents average reward and stability at different learning rates.
• Plots precision per episode across different learning rates.
Results
The repository includes visualizations of reward functions, learning rate comparison, and 
precision values per episode during RL training.
